 Gynecologist Nikhil Datar said miscarriage, being a multifactorial issue, causes cannot merely be related to availability of medical services and infrastructure. “In 95% cases, which take place in first trimester of pregnancy, chances of its survival are low. Hence, one has to look at the data with perspective of total number of pregnancies. There is a possibility that because number of pregnancies in rural parts are high, they report more cases of miscarriages”
